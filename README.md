# CONNECT 4 
Connect 4 is a simple two-player game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a suspended grid. The original grid size has seven-columns horizontally and six-rows vertically, but as the years passed by, the game has expanded to different board sizes and variants. The pieces simply fall straight down one after the other, occupying the next available space within that column.

The main objective of the game is to be the first person to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four with the player's respective colored discs. As simple as the game is, there are lots of strategies to be played in order to win.
